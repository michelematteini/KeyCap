# KeyCap

This is an old project I used many years ago for remapping input. I still find it useful sometimes.

## Description
*Windows only* application for capture keyboard input and remapping it to:
* another key or sequence of keys
* mouse input
* nothing at all

## TODO:
* Add a new release (currently available here: [Download Key2Key](https://www.nhmk.com/tools.php)
* Code comments
* Code cleanup
* Proper description for how it all works! I have forgotten some of the details...

## Warning
This program does perform keyboard capture and is essentially the first component of a key logger. I humbly request you NOT use the information included in the source code to create a malicious application.
